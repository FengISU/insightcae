The first step is to install the CAE tools which you want to interface with Insight CAE:
 * OpenFOAM (see installation instructions at http://openfoam.org/download) 

Then you have currently different choices for the installation of Insight:

1. Build insight against system-installed dependencies 
   This is usually possible but might cause problems due to unsupported versions 
   of dependencies on some linux distributions.
   
2. Build insight together with all dependencies
   This is required, if 1) does not work, like on older distributions
   and e.g. cluster installations.

STEPS for Option 1
==================

1. Prepare system for compilation
   install basic packages:
   * Fedora-20: 
     # yum install gcc-c++ git libX11-devel libXext-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libOSMesa-devel cmake qt-devel \
        qwt-devel armadillo-devel boost-devel gsl-devel python-devel python-matplotlib numpy gnuplot
   * 

STEPS for Option 2
==================

1. Prepare system for compilation
   install basic packages:
   * Fedora-20: gcc-c++, git, libX11-devel, libXext-devel, mesa-libGL-devel, mesa-libOSMesa-devel
   * 
   
3. Clone insight source code
   $ cd $HOME/<path/to/installation>
   $ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/insightcae/code insight
   
4. Build dependencies
   First of all, add a "source" statement to your bashrc for settings a proper bin and lib path.
   This is already required during build, so insert the follwing statement into your "~/.bashrc"
   and activate the changes by continuing in a new terminal:
   > source $HOME/<path/to/installation>/insight/thirdparty/bashrc
   Change into the build directory
   $ cd insight/thirdparty_src
   download and unpack dependency tarball pack:
   $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/insightcae/files/dependencies/insight-dependency-tarballs.tgz
   $ tar xzf insight-dependency-tarballs.tgz
   build all packages:
   $ ./build_all.sh
   
4. Install OpenFOAM
5. Insert Addons, if required
6. Build Insight CAE
