The first step is to install the CAE tools which you want to interface with Insight CAE:
 * OpenFOAM (see installation instructions at http://openfoam.org/download) 
 * Code_Aster (see installation instructions at http://www.code-aster.org/)

Then you have currently different choices for the installation of Insight:

A. Build insight against system-installed dependencies 
   This is usually possible but might cause problems due to unsupported versions 
   of dependencies on some linux distributions.
   
B. Build insight together with dependencies
   This is required, if 1) does not work, like on older distributions
   and e.g. cluster installations. You can also build only a subset of the
   dependencies by yourself and use as much from the system as possible.

   
   
In the following, the meaning of lines starting a following characters is:
- "$": command to be executed in a terminal as normal user
- "#": command to be executed in a terminal as the system administrator
- ">": a line in a text file (the content is without the '>')

STEPS for Option A
==================

1. Prepare system for compilation
   install basic packages:
   
   * Fedora-20: 
   
     from repositories:
     # yum install gcc-c++ git libX11-devel libXext-devel libXmu-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libOSMesa-devel cmake qt-devel \
        qwt-devel armadillo-devel boost-devel gsl-devel python-devel swig doxygen graphviz \
        python-matplotlib numpy gnuplot texlive OCE-devel
        
     and precompiled from the insight download area:
     # rpm -ivh http://sourceforge.net/projects/insightcae/files/dependencies/dxflib-3.7.5-fedora20.x86_64.rpm
     # rpm -ivh http://sourceforge.net/projects/insightcae/files/dependencies/salomegeom-7.2.0-fedora20.x86_64.rpm
     
   * 

2. Clone the sources and build

   $ cd <path/for/installation>
   $ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/insightcae/code insight
   
   (Optional) If you want to use any addons, navigate to the addon directory 
   in the source tree and clone them:
   $ cd insight/src/addons
   $ git clone url://.....
   $ cd ../../..
   
   Create a build directory
   $ cd insight; mkdir build; cd build
   
   Configure
   $ ccmake ..
   
   Now you can set options, correct paths, disable certain parts of insight etc.
   Then compile, e.g. in parallel on 4 processors (change this according to your hardware):
   $ make -j4
   
   (Optional) build the documentation:
   $ make doc
   
3. Set up your environment
   
   Add a statement to your "~/.bashrc" file to
   include the bin/ and lib/ dirs to the search
   path:
   > source <path/for/installation>/insight/build/bin/setenv.sh
   
   
   
STEPS for Option B
==================

1. Make sure, the basic headers and libraries for compilation are installed:
   * gcc-c++, git
   * If you want to include GUIs: libX11, libXext, libXmu, libGL, libOSMesa
   * 
   
3. Clone insight source code
   $ cd $HOME/<path/to/installation>
   $ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/insightcae/code insight
   
4. Build dependencies
   First of all, add a "source" statement to your bashrc for settings a proper bin and lib path.
   This is already required during build, so insert the follwing statement into your "~/.bashrc"
   and activate the changes by continuing in a new terminal:
   > source $HOME/<path/to/installation>/insight/thirdparty/bashrc
   Change into the build directory
   $ cd insight/thirdparty_src
   download and unpack dependency tarball pack:
   $ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/insightcae/files/dependencies/insight-dependency-tarballs.tgz
   $ tar xzf insight-dependency-tarballs.tgz
   build all packages:
   $ ./build_all.sh
   
4. Install OpenFOAM
5. Insert Addons, if required
6. Build Insight CAE
