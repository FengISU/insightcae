This  data  base  of  a  plane  turbulent  mixing  layer  contains  two  levels  of
data.  The main features of the flow,  the turbulent quantities and energy
balance  are  contained  in  the  following  directories
 
    o  SHL04/flow :  Flow definition parameters and initial profile for experiment 1.
    o  SHL04/turb  :  useful  turbulent  quantities (<u'u'>, <u'v'>, ...)
    o  SHL04/data  :  various velocity moments for experiments 1 to 5.
    o  SHL04/balance  :  turbulent  energy  balance
    o  SHL04/pdf  :  probability density function of one-point velocity components
    o  SHL04/PDF2  : probability density function of two-point velocity differences
    o  SHL04/spectra: one-dimensional energy spectra
 
More detailed data, including raw data, are  also  available.
 
    To get a quick overview of what this data base contains, type SHL04/mkovrvw
this  script  file  will  display  on  your  X  terminal  the  main  quantities 
available (only in the on-line version of the data base).
